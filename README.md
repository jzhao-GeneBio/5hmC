# 5hmC associated with Alzheimer's disease (Brain 5-hydroxymethylcytosine alterations are associated with Alzheimerâ€™s disease neuropathology)
The programs shown here were used to perform the alignment of the fastq files to human genome (hg38), peak calling, and downstream analyses (e.g., association analysis, enrichment analysis) for identifying AD neuropathology-associated 5hmCs.
